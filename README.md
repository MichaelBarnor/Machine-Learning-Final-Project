Created my own dataset of 2700+ images from self-recorded videos.
To run this:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Run head_pose_cnn.py on dataset (DISCLAIMER: the dataset is composed of a lot of images, so be sure you want to download it)
3. Run predict_test.py on a file in the sample_test folder. Accuracy is higher on images of myself due to the size of the dataset.
Here is a link to my dataset labeled [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wYflkOnePgg67w36qbLmXAw_Ir0SlUpn?usp=sharing).
